# Mobile_Keyboard_Optimization_Genetic_Algorithm

Mobile keyboard layout optimization for one thumb typing comfort.

This is done using Keren Nivasch and Amos Azaria's genetic algorithm for keyboard layout performance optimization and Le Xiong et al's Thumb Jacobian Matrix for thumb comfortability scores.

How this is different than Keren Nivasch and Amos Azaria's algorithm:
1) Thumb comfortability taken into performance evaluation.
2) Applied to one thumb typing on mobile screen dimensions.
3) Sequential typing instead of returning to closest resting position to be more representative of mobile typing.
